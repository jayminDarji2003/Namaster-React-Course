Q1) Difference in Named Exports, Default Exports and * as Exports
Ans) -->
	1. Named Exprots :-
		In the Named Exports, in the one file there are multiple Named Exports.Then import the specific export in the curly {} braces.	The name of the imported module should be same as the exported module.
	
	2. Default Exports :-
		In the one file there are only one Default exports.
	syntax :-
		export default functionName;	
	-> When we import the module then we should give any name to it.It is not mandatory to give same name export gives.

	3. * as export:-
		* as export means if there are multiple exports in one file and we want to export all of it as the named given.
	syntax :-
		import * as myCalc from './components'

Q2) Importance of Config.js file
Ans) -->In React there are lots of things used multiple times so do not write every time just put it into one file and then import whenever we want to use.
	ex. In the project if One link used many times so developer suggest that put it into one file and import where we want.

Q3) What are the React Hooks?
Ans) --> React Hook is introduced in 16.8 version of react.
	->Hooks are JavaScript functions that manage the state's behaviour and side effects by isolating them from a component.
	->So, we can now isolate all the stateful logic in hooks and use (compose them, as hooks are functions, too) into the components.
	Hook ex. useState, useEffect, useContext

Q4) why we need useState?
Ans) --> When we want to manage our state then the useState Hook are used.As we know useState() is a Hook and Hook is a function so this useState() function return a Array. In the Array the are two values, 1 is variable and 2nd is function which is used to change the state of variable.
